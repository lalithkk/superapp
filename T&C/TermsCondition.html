        <h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions, and any separate agreements through which we provide you Services, shall be governed, construed, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Republic of India, without regard to its conflict of laws rules.
        <br/>You acknowledge and agree that your access to and use of the Vymora platform, services, website, and applications are governed by and subject to the applicable laws, regulations, and rules prevailing in India.
        <br/>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to your use of our services, including without limitation the validity, interpretation, breach, or termination of these Terms, both parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the matter through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date either party notifies the other of the dispute.
        <br/>If the dispute remains unresolved even after such informal negotiations, it shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts located at [India], and you irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.
        <br/>You further agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Services must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
        <br/>Vymora retains the right to seek injunctive relief, equitable remedies, or any similar urgent interim measures before any competent court to protect its intellectual property rights or to prevent unauthorized use of the Services without first engaging in informal negotiation.
        <br/>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any additional agreements that you may enter into with Vymora in connection with the Services, constitute the entire agreement between you and Vymora concerning your use of the Services and supersede any prior agreements, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.
        <br/>Should any provision of these Terms be found to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable while preserving its intent. If modification is not possible, that provision shall be severed from the Terms, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
        <br/>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Vymora.
        <br/>We reserve the right to bring proceedings relating to the enforcement of intellectual property rights or to recover debts in any competent jurisdiction where such rights are being infringed or debts are being accrued.
        <br/>By continuing to use our Services, you affirm that you understand and accept the exclusive governing law and dispute resolution framework outlined herein.
